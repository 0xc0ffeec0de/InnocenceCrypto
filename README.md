# Crypt-DES-based
     
     DES-based password hash algorithm
     The crypton is in progress made by mob and onion 
     we are working to keep the code clean and doing 
     what should be its purpose

# Help
     
     Compile ::
        gcc -Wall main.c -o main -lcrypt
     Usage   ::
        ./main
        
# Info
     Crypton ::
     
     CryptOM Beta Temporary!! 
     Crypton is a crypt made entirely in C 
     encrypting your password making it unviable to be broken 
     easily we are adding new features 
     to crypton to be able to leave the beta
     
     CryptDES ::
     
     CryptDES (Data Encryption Standard) 
     is imported from lib unistd.h by encrypting 
     your password and then 
     switching to hex with HexCryptDES
